# Anthologia Mobile UI

Anthologia is based on this white paper [Can Decentralized Technologies be the Vanguard Against Censorship and Data Exploitation in the Digital Age?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RIsW4aiMNqTvEdjwzu6p3mA6TN_FH0gSYrbj699pds)

Anthologia is an application that allows journalists and whistleblowers to write articles on topics that interest them and which are stored on the blockchain, thus allowing the decentralization of information making it uncensorable. This is the problem that Anthologia solves by offering web and mobile support.


## How does it work?

The mobile application communicates either with a centralized back-end or with IPFS, for more information on this subject, you can consult our [white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RIsW4aiMNqTvEdjwzu6p3mA6TN_FH0gSYrbj699pds).
